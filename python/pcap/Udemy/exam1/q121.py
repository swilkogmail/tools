# What is the output of the following code snippet?

# print(str(2/3)[-1])

# 2/3 is a valid operation and evaluates to 0.66666666666666666  (a float).

# The str() function will convert the float to a string.

# str(2/3)[-1]    is a slicing operation on the string and will return the last character of the string which is 6 .

# Finally the print() function will print 6 on the screen.

print(str(2/3)[-1])
