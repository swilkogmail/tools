# The yield statement can be used only inside functions. 
# The yield statement suspends the  function execution and 
# causes the function to return the yield's argument as a result. 
# Such a function cannot be invoked in a regular way â€“ 
# its only purpose is to be used as a generator.

# In the above question, when n=3 ,range(n,n+2,1)  
# will generate the following sequence : [3,4] (as always, 
# the end of the range (5)  is excluded from the sequence).

# so for loop for i in range(n,n+2,1):   will go through 2 iterations.

# At the first iteration, res = 1 , so the yield statement generates 1.

# At the 2nd iteration, res= 2*1=2, so the yield statement generates 2.

# Finally, the last statement y = [x for x in myfunc(3)] 
# is a list comprehension which is a way to create a list from an expression.
