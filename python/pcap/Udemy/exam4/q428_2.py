# Which statement about property __dict__ is true ?

# Explanation:

# All object instance variables (private or not) are stored inside a dedicated dictionary 
# named __dict__, contained in every object separately. Class variables are not contained in the corresponding object __dict__ property.

# A class also has a __dict__ property which stores its class variables and its methods.
