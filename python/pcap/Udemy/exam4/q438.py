# You want to open file myfile.txt (which exists) and add some additional text after the existing content.

# Which code below will get you started ?

# Explanation:

# Open mode 'a' will open the file in append mode : any new data written to the file will 
# be added at the end of the existing content. 't' is for text mode (as opposed to 'b' for binary mode).

# The other open modes provided in the questions are:

# - 'rt' :  read + text

# - 'wt' : write + text - any existing content in the file will be deleted when opening the file.

# - 'xt' : opens the file for exclusive creation+ text
