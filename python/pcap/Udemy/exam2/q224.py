# You have to remove the installed package StrWr from your Python development environment.

# Which pip command would you use to achieve this ?

# Explanation:

# pip install -U StrWr ->This will update the already installed package StrWr - that's not what we want.

# pip -uninstall StrWr -> This is incorrect syntax

# pip remove StrWr-> remove does not exist as a pip command

# pip uninstall StrWr -> This will correctly uninstall the package StrWr which is what we want.
