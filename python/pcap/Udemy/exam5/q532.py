# sep keyword argument in the print() function allows to specify the separator between 
# elements being printed. Its default value is a single space. Setting a value of None for this 
# argument is the same as the default value (single space).

# end keyword argument in the print() function allows to specify what character to use to end 
# the printed line.  Its default value is \n (new line). Setting a value of None for this argument is the same as the default value (new line).
