# What is the output of the following snippet of the user enters two lines containing 2 and 4 respectively ?

x = input()
y = int(input())
print(x * y)

# Explanation:

# The input() function always returns a string. So x is a string.

# The int() function converts its argument (string, float, etc...) to an int. So, y is an int.

# The * operator can be used with one string ABC and an int x : the result will be the string ABC repeated x times.
